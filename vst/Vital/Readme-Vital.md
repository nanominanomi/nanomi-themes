## how to install?
there's two way you can install a vital theme
1. the easy way
	1. open vital and hold alt when clicking the menu on the top right (it's next to the volume meter)
	2. click ==load theme== and choose the theme you want to set!
2. the hard way(?
	1. put the theme file into
	   >%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Vital\Factory\Skins
	2. go to vital's advance tab
	3. and choose from the down left's theme section
>[!warning] notice
>if you use the easy way, vital would not save the theme you've load before!
>but  using the hard way,  all the  themes you've put in that folder can be choose from the drop down menu
>so i recommend using the second method !!
